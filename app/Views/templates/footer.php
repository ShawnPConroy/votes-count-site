    <p>The Votes Count Project is made by a small group of volunteers and advisors from
        different political parties and indepdents, all of whom live or lived in Barrie.
        This website hopes to grow through public data to help people vote across Canada
        and encourage people who are close to voting but need a little information about
        the process or their local candidates.</p>
