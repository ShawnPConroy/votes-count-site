    <h1 id="homeTitle">Votes Count</h1>
    <p>Hi. I'm Shawn. I've always been interested in politics. I just want to make it easier for people to be engagaged in politics, either by <a href="/vote/">finding your candidates and voting</a>, or <a href="/reps/">contact your representative</a>.</p>
    <p>Those are the main section I will be rolling out over 2023.</p>

<section>
    <h3><a href="/reps/"><span class="icon major fa-institution"></span> Your Representatives</a></h3>
    <p>I have collected data about all the representatives for every region in Barrie are. By selecting your ward, you will see who your MP, MPP, Mayor, Ward and school board trustee is.</p>
</section>
<section>
    <h3><a href="/vote/"><span class="icon major fa-check"></span> Election Data</a></h3>
    <p>Here, I make a page for each election. Some past election pages are also available here, so you can see who ran. This is where election survey data goes. It's a great way to learn more about your candidates. Eventually this will include election results.</p>

        <p>Got info? If you know something that should be updated, added or corrected on this website, <a href="https://feedback.votescount.ca/">let me know</a>. This is a hobby for me.
